# Video Meeting

Google Meet / Zoom clone in a few lines of code.

Video Meeting is a video conference website that lets you stay in touch with all your friends.

Developed with ReactJS, Node.js, SocketIO.

I have also attached a demo video, presentation file and a report for the same. The project is created using the reference of Sebastien Biollo's video chatting app project which is 100% open source.

### Features
